# Electric-Vehicle-Brand-Distribution


Displays a pie chart showing what percentage of electric vehicles (EVs) are sold by each brand, using government data from Washington State.

---

## Features

- Visualizes brand distribution of EVs with a pie chart  
- Uses real-world government data from Washington state  
- Reads brand data from a `.txt` file  
- Counts occurrences using Python's built-in `collections.Counter`  
- Uses custom helper functions for clean code  

---

## How It Works

- The dataset (`car_data.txt`) contains one EV brand per line  
- The program counts how many times each brand appears  
- A pie chart is generated using `matplotlib` to show the percentage distribution  
- The code is separated into a main script and a helper module for clarity

## Concepts Used

- File input and CSV parsing  
- Frequency counting with `collections.Counter`  
- Programming with helper functions  
- Data visualization using `matplotlib`  
- Lists and string handling
